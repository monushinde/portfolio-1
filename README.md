Markdown (.md): Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text formatting syntax. It's commonly used for readme files due to its simplicity and readability. Markdown files typically have a .md extension.

Plain Text (.txt): Readme files can also be written in plain text format. These files have a .txt extension and don't support formatting like Markdown, but they are widely compatible with all text editors.

HTML (.html): Readme files can be written in HTML format, which allows for more advanced formatting and styling. However, HTML readme files are less common compared to Markdown or plain text formats.

Rich Text Format (.rtf): RTF is a document format developed by Microsoft. While less common for readme files, RTF files support basic text formatting such as bold, italics, and colors.

PDF (.pdf): Portable Document Format is a widely used format for sharing documents. While less common for readme files, some projects may provide a PDF version of their readme for easier printing or distribution.

Word Document (.docx): Microsoft Word documents are another option for readme files. However, they may not be as widely compatible as plain text or Markdown files.
